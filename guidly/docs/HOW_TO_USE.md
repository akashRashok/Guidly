## Tips for Teachers

### Creating Effective Assignments

1. **Keep It Focused**
   - One topic per assignment
   - 3-5 questions is usually enough
   - Focus on concepts, not just procedures

2. **Use Clear Questions**
   - Write questions that test understanding, not just recall
   - Make sure correct answers are unambiguous
   - Consider common wrong answers when writing questions

3. **Choose Appropriate Topics**
   - Select topics that align with your current teaching
   - Use the topic to help the system identify misconceptions
   - General topic works if none of the specific topics fit

### Interpreting Results

1. **Look for Patterns**
   - Multiple students with the same misconception = teaching opportunity
   - One student struggling = individual support needed
   - High accuracy = students understood the concept

2. **Use the Recommendations**
   - The AI-generated summary suggests what to revisit
   - Focus on the most common misconceptions first
   - Don't try to address everything at once

3. **Follow Up in Class**
   - Use the misconception data to plan your next lesson
   - Address the most common issues
   - Provide additional examples or explanations

## Tips for Students

### Getting the Most from Feedback

1. **Read Carefully**
   - Don't skip the explanation
   - Try to understand why your answer was wrong
   - Think about the misconception mentioned

2. **Use the Follow-Up**
   - The follow-up question tests your understanding
   - Take your time to think about it
   - It's okay if you're still learning

3. **Don't Worry About Mistakes**
   - Making mistakes is part of learning
   - The feedback helps you understand
   - Your teacher uses this information to help everyone

### For Students

1. **Honesty**: Use your real name (or the format your teacher requested)

3. **Learning**: Use feedback to understand, not just to complete
4. **Communication**: Ask your teacher if you're confused

## Privacy & Data
